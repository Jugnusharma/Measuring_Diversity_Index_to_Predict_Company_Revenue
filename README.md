# Python Code for diversity_index

To calculate the Simpson's Diversity Index we follow these steps:

**1. Identify the Proportions for 2024:**
Black: 0 individuals
Hispanic: 0 individuals
White: 100 individuals
Total individuals: 0+0+100=1000 + 0 + 100 = 1000+0+100=100

**2. Calculate the Proportions for Each Group:**
Proportion of Black=0100=0\text{Proportion of Black} = \frac{0}{100} = 0Proportion of Black=1000=0 Proportion of Hispanic=0100=0\text{Proportion of Hispanic} = \frac{0}{100} = 0Proportion of Hispanic=1000=0 Proportion of White=100100=1\text{Proportion of White} = \frac{100}{100} = 1Proportion of White=100100=1

**3. Square the Proportions:**
(0)2=0(0)^2 = 0(0)2=0 (0)2=0(0)^2 = 0(0)2=0 (1)2=1(1)^2 = 1(1)2=1

**4. Sum the Squared Proportions:**
Sum of squared proportions=0+0+1=1\text{Sum of squared proportions} = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1Sum of squared proportions=0+0+1=1

**5. Apply Simpson's Diversity Index Formula:**
Simpson's Diversity Index is calculated as:
D=1−∑(Proportion2)D = 1 - \sum \left(\text{Proportion}^2\right)D=1−∑(Proportion2) D=1−1=0D = 1 - 1 = 0D=1−1=0
Result:
The diversity index for 2024 is 0 because all the individuals belong to a single ethnic group, resulting in no diversity. This formula reflects that when there is only one group present (no diversity), the index is 0.
